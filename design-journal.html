      <h2>Week One</h2>
      <p><i>Prompt:</i> What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or
        technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you
        butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
      <p><i>Response:</i> I'm most looking forward to expanding my vocabulary and becoming more aware of the ways I can
        better collaborate with developers. I'm also looking forward to bumbling a little bit less aimlessly through
        custom code on site builders like Squarespace and Cargo. The site that I LOVE is linked below. It doesn't seem
        incredibly complicated, so if I left this class with the ability to code something like this...that would be
        pretty cool.</p>

      <h2>Week Two</h2>
      <p><i>Prompt:</i> What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make
        each
        page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and
        typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
      <p><i>Response:</i>  I'm making a microsite for the BRUMMM Chronicles (a motorcycle photo-editorial publication), which
        currently has 4 issues. Each page will feature an issue and mimick the style tweaks found in the print version.
        For example, every issue ends with an extensive interview section printed on a uniquely colored paper stock, so
        that color can come through in the respective subpage. I imageine that typography will remain constistant
        throughout, but layout will likely shift between subpages. As far as content, I'm planning for the site to be
        image heavy. This will probably include both images of the magazines and scans of interior spreads, since this
        sort of imagery can't be found anywhere at the moment. I really want to highight the contemporary high-design
        nature of the series, which makes it so unique in the moto-world.</p>

      <h2>Week Three</h2>
      <p><i>Prompt:</i> This weeks journal prompt, I want you to clearly imagine one user who'll love to use your
        Project 1 website. This user could be you, it could be someone similar to you, it could be someone completely
        opposite from you, it could even be a non-human animal or an alien or an amoeba. You get to choose. Really
        imagine what they are like in their mind. What do they spend their time on? what are their hobbies, clothes,
        music, favorite foods, books, tv. what's their personality like. Once you've imagined this person. write about
        them. just a paragraph, three to five sentences. try to have fun with it.</p>
      <p><i>Response:</i> The Brummm Chronicals user is a die-hard motorcycle lover. A machanic at heart with a love for systems and functionality, but never one to turn their back on aesthetics. They like to know how things work. But this user is not an "internet" person. Maybe they watch a lot of Youtube videos of flattrack racing and bike-mod tutorials. So they appreciate a site where functionality prevails and content (their all time favorite mag) shines through. </p>
