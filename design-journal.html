      <h2>Week One</h2>
      <p><i>Prompt:</i> What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or
        technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you
        butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
      <p><i>Response:</i> I'm most looking forward to expanding my vocabulary and becoming more aware of the ways I can
        better collaborate with developers. I'm also looking forward to bumbling a little bit less aimlessly through
        custom code on site builders like Squarespace and Cargo. The site that I LOVE is linked below. It doesn't seem
        incredibly complicated, so if I left this class with the ability to code something like this...that would be
        pretty cool.</p>

      <h2>Week Two</h2>
      <p><i>Prompt:</i>  What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each
        page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and
        typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
      <p>Response: I'm making a microsite for the BRUMMM Chronicles (a motorcycle photo-editorial publication), which
        currently has 4 issues. Each page will feature an issue and mimick the style tweaks found in the print version.
        For example, every issue ends with an extensive interview section printed on a uniquely colored paper stock, so
        that color can come through in the respective subpage. I imageine that typography will remain constistant
        throughout, but layout will likely shift between subpages. As far as content, I'm planning for the site to be
        image heavy. This will probably include both images of the magazines and scans of interior spreads, since this
        sort of imagery can't be found anywhere at the moment. I really want to highight the contemporary high-design
        nature of the series, which makes it so unique in the moto-world.</p>
