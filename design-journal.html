      <h2>Week One</h2>
      <p><i>Prompt:</i> What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or
        technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you
        butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
      <p><i>Response:</i> I'm most looking forward to expanding my vocabulary and becoming more aware of the ways I can
        better collaborate with developers. I'm also looking forward to bumbling a little bit less aimlessly through
        custom code on site builders like Squarespace and Cargo. The site that I LOVE is linked below. It doesn't seem
        incredibly complicated, so if I left this class with the ability to code something like this...that would be
        pretty cool.</p>

      <h2>Week Two</h2>
      <p><i>Prompt:</i> What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make
        each
        page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and
        typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
      <p><i>Response:</i> I'm making a microsite for the BRUMMM Chronicles (a motorcycle photo-editorial publication),
        which
        currently has 4 issues. Each page will feature an issue and mimick the style tweaks found in the print version.
        For example, every issue ends with an extensive interview section printed on a uniquely colored paper stock, so
        that color can come through in the respective subpage. I imageine that typography will remain constistant
        throughout, but layout will likely shift between subpages. As far as content, I'm planning for the site to be
        image heavy. This will probably include both images of the magazines and scans of interior spreads, since this
        sort of imagery can't be found anywhere at the moment. I really want to highight the contemporary high-design
        nature of the series, which makes it so unique in the moto-world.</p>

      <h2>Week Three</h2>
      <p><i>Prompt:</i> This weeks journal prompt, I want you to clearly imagine one user who'll love to use your
        Project 1 website. This user could be you, it could be someone similar to you, it could be someone completely
        opposite from you, it could even be a non-human animal or an alien or an amoeba. You get to choose. Really
        imagine what they are like in their mind. What do they spend their time on? what are their hobbies, clothes,
        music, favorite foods, books, tv. what's their personality like. Once you've imagined this person. write about
        them. just a paragraph, three to five sentences. try to have fun with it.</p>
      <p><i>Response:</i> The Brummm Chronicals user is a die-hard motorcycle lover. A machanic at heart with a love for
        systems and functionality, but never one to turn their back on aesthetics. They like to know how things work.
        But this user is not an "internet" person. Maybe they watch a lot of Youtube videos of flattrack racing and
        bike-mod tutorials. So they appreciate a site where functionality prevails and content (their all time favorite
        mag) shines through. </p>

      <h2>Week Six</h2>
      <p><i>Prompt:</i> Why did you choose the business/cause that you chose? Why do you think your redesign will be
        better? What area/content will you focus on in your redesign? Look at two other similar websites. What stands
        out about those sites? what bothers you abut them? How will you improve things in your own design.</p>
      <p><i>Response:</i> I chose KMHD Jazz Radio because, well, I listen to KMHD and All Classical everyday. I grew up
        studying/playing both jazz & classical music. And I LOVE the KMHD brand, but their website does not do the brand
        justice. When I'm out of town I use their website to stream, so I think integrating the streaming component at
        the bottom of the screen will be my #1 priority. I'm also interested in better representing their events page
        (although there
        is not any current content at the moment) and their funding/donations/gifting structure. They have all this
        amazing super cool merch that you can only get if you donate. And donation pages are always weird. Overall, I
        think the site could use a redesign that highlights the beautifully contemporary brand that they have build over
        the last few years. It needs to cater to a younger generation, the next wave of supporters, so that this station
        can stay alive and well for decades to come. <br>
        Other radio station websites are similarly out of date. KMHD is actually better than most and All Classical is
        probably the best I've seen. Most of them are rather static with a lot of content jammed onto every page.
        Typography tends to look unrefined and the nav is either in a weird spot or way too full. I plan to utlize more
        negative space, which will look great with KMHD's standard black background) and create a very tight and
        controlled heirarchy for both typography and navigation.</p>

      <h2>Week Eight</h2>
      <p><i>Prompt:</i> Read <a
          href="https://medium.com/@Vincentxia77/what-is-mobile-first-design-why-its-important-how-to-make-it-7d3cf2e29d00">this</a>
        article on mobile first design and share your thoughts on mobile first vs desktop first. </p>
      <p><i>Response:</i>While I understand the idea that mobile usage prevails and should drive our designs, I don't
        accept the premise of the article. A good designer can create a desktop site which converts to mobile without
        hacking away the beauty and functionality. A good designer starts with a lean and functional design, no matter
        the format. The author of this article is not the first to make this assumption about designers. And there
        certainly are designers who's work would benefit from starting with more restraints. But, this is in now way
        confined to web design. In my opinion, this has do to with design education, accessibility, and teaching
        designers to prioritize function over form. I think the *ideal* way to design for web is to simultaneously be
        working in both desktop and mobile. Designers should be constantly thinking about how their designs both
        communicate information and reflow between formats. If their designs accomodate changes in format from the very
        beginning, the designs themselves will also be more considered and consistant. </p>
